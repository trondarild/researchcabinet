## From zero to AI team in 2 minutes

```bash
npx create-cabinet@latest
cd cabinet
npm run dev:all
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The onboarding wizard builds your custom AI team in 5 questions.

---

## The problem

Every time you start a new Claude session, it forgets everything. Your project context, your decisions, your research — gone. Scattered docs in Notion. AI sessions with no memory. Manual copy-paste between tools.

## The solution

One knowledge base. AI agents that remember everything. Scheduled jobs that compound. Your team grows while you sleep.

> If it feels like enterprise workflow software, it's wrong. If it feels like watching a team work, it's right.

---

## Philosophy

Cabinet is built around a few principles that we think matter deeply for the future of AI + data tools:

- **Yours** — Your data stays yours: local, visible, and portable. It’s not trapped inside a particular AI provider’s system with no clean way to get it out. You stay in control of your information.
- **Git everything** — Memory should have history. You should be able to inspect changes, revert mistakes, audit how knowledge evolves, and treat your AI system like the important infrastructure it is.
- **BYOAI** — Bring your own AI. Cabinet should work with Claude, Codex, OpenCode, local models, and whatever comes next, without forcing your knowledge into a single provider’s ecosystem.
- **KISS** — Keep it simple, stupid. AI tools should be understandable, inspectable, and hackable. We prefer plain files, clear behavior, and systems that developers can actually reason about.
- **Security** — We care deeply about security. If AI is going to work with your documents, research, plans, and internal context, the system should minimize surprise, reduce unnecessary exposure, and make trust a design requirement rather than an afterthought.
- **Self-hosted** — If AI is going to hold your context, plans, research, and operating memory, it should run in an environment you control.

## Everything you need. Nothing you don't.

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| **WYSIWYG + Markdown** | Rich text editing with Tiptap. Tables, code blocks, slash commands. |
| **AI Agents** | Each has goals, skills, scheduled jobs. Watch them work like a real team. |
| **Scheduled Jobs** | Cron-based agent automation. Reddit scout every 6 hours. Weekly reports on Monday. |
| **Embedded HTML Apps** | Drop an `index.html` in any folder — it renders as an iframe. Full-screen mode. |
| **Web Terminal** | Full local AI CLI terminal in the browser. xterm.js + node-pty. |
| **File-Based Everything** | No database. Markdown on disk. Your data is always yours, always portable. |
| **Git-Backed History** | Every save auto-commits. Full diff viewer. Restore any page to any point in time. |
| **Missions & Tasks** | Break goals into missions. Track progress with Kanban boards. |
| **Internal Chat** | Built-in team channels. Agents and humans communicate. |
| **Full-Text Search** | Cmd+K instant search across all pages. Fuzzy matching. |
| **PDF & CSV Viewers** | First-class support for PDFs and spreadsheets. |
| **Dark/Light Mode** | Theme toggle. Dark mode by default. |

## Ship HTML apps inside your knowledge base

This is the biggest difference between Cabinet and tools like Obsidian or Notion. Drop an `index.html` in any directory — it renders as an embedded app. Full-screen mode with sidebar auto-collapse. AI-generated apps written directly into your KB. Version controlled via git. No build step.

---

## Not another note-taking app

| Feature | Cabinet | Obsidian | Notion |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI agent orchestration | Yes | No | No |
| Scheduled cron jobs | Yes | No | No |
| Embedded HTML apps | Yes | No | No |
| Web terminal | Yes | No | No |
| Self-hosted, files on disk | Yes | Yes | No |
| No database / no lock-in | Yes | Yes | No |
| Git-backed version history | Yes | Via plugin | No |
| WYSIWYG + Markdown | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## Hire your AI team in 5 questions

Cabinet ships with 20 pre-built agent templates. Each has a role, recurring jobs, and a workspace in the knowledge base.

| Department | Agents |
|---|---|
| **Leadership** | CEO, COO, CFO, CTO |
| **Product** | Product Manager, UX Designer |
| **Marketing** | Content Marketer, SEO Specialist, Social Media, Growth Marketer, Copywriter |
| **Engineering** | Editor, QA Agent, DevOps Engineer |
| **Sales & Support** | Sales Agent, Customer Success |
| **Analytics** | Data Analyst |
| **Operations** | People Ops, Legal Advisor, Researcher |

---

## How it works

1. **Install & Run** — One command. Next.js + daemon start.
2. **Answer 5 Questions** — Cabinet builds your custom AI team.
3. **Watch Your Team Work** — Agents create missions, write content, scout Reddit, file reports.
4. **Knowledge Compounds** — Every agent run, every edit adds to the KB. Context builds over time.

---

## Architecture

```
cabinet/
  src/
    app/api/         -> Next.js API routes
    components/      -> React components (sidebar, editor, agents, jobs, terminal)
    stores/          -> Zustand state management
    lib/             -> Storage, markdown, git, agents, jobs
  server/
    cabinet-daemon.ts -> WebSocket + job scheduler + agent executor
  data/
    .agents/.library/ -> 20 pre-built agent templates
    getting-started/  -> Default KB page
```

**Tech stack:** Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Tiptap, Zustand, xterm.js, node-cron

---

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 20+
- At least one supported CLI provider:
  - **Claude Code CLI** (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
  - **Codex CLI** (`npm install -g @openai/codex` or `brew install --cask codex`)
- macOS or Linux (Windows via WSL)

## Configuration

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `KB_PASSWORD` | _(empty)_ | Password to protect the UI. Leave empty for no auth. |
| `DOMAIN` | `localhost` | Domain for the app. |

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Next.js dev server (port 3000)
npm run dev:daemon   # Terminal + job scheduler (port 3001)
npm run dev:all      # Both servers
npm run build        # Production build
npm run start        # Production mode (both servers)
```
